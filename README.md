# GitHub Activity Fetcher  

This is a simple Node.js application that fetches a user's recent GitHub activity from the GitHub API.  

## Features  
- Prompts the user to enter a GitHub username in the terminal.  
- Fetches and displays the user's recent activity from GitHub.  
- Uses the `https` module to send API requests.  
- Runs a basic Express server on port `3000`.  

## Prerequisites  
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a new directory.  
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.  
3. Run the following command to install Express:  
   ```sh
   npm install express
   ```
4. Start the application:  
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```
   *(Replace `index.js` with the actual filename if different.)*  

## Usage  
1. After starting the app, enter a GitHub username when prompted.  
2. The app will fetch and display the user's recent GitHub activity.  

## Notes  
- The application uses the GitHub API, which requires a `User-Agent` header for requests.  
- If the user has no recent activity, the output may be empty.
